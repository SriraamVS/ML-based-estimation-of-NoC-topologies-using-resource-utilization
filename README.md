**Abstract**

Modern System on Chip (SoC) designs encounter challenges associated with conventional bus-based communication systems. As technology advances and the complexity of SoC designs increase, traditional communication architectures become a bottleneck, hindering the scalability of the integrated systems. To address these limitations, Networkon-Chip (NoC) communication emerges as a promising solution. NoCs offer enhanced flexibility, allowing designers to tailor communication networks to specific application requirements. This project focuses on designing and evaluating various NoC topologies, including Mesh, Fat-tree, Torus, Star and Mesh of Torus. Each topology undergoes synthesis and implementation processes, and the resulting data is subjected to feature scaling and preprocessing. Feature scaling and preprocessing enhance the model's ability to make accurate predictions by ensuring uniformity and relevance in the input variables. Subsequently, a machine learning model employing regression techniques is trained to predict scores (R-squared value) based on hardware resource utilization, topology, and cluster size. Insights from the model aid designers in selecting suitable topologies and allocating resources effectively.
